Installation instructions
==============

To use craft, simply add Craft.dll and Randomizer.cs to your Unity
project.  You can also add the other Unity components for testing
purposes if you like.

Having added the dll and Randomizer.cs, you can add a randomizer to a
game object by choosing Craft/Randomizer from the Components menu and
fill in the Randomizer's Variables and Constraints arrays.
